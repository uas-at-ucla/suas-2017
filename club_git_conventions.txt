Hi, here's the rundown of how our git is setup (as of 2017)

This uas repo will be the main club repo so we can grab all our code at once.

We'll make a branch for each year at least, and merge those into master,
which'll be the current repo.

Because many of our projects could sensibly be their own repos, let's make
them as repos on our own github accounts, add the main club github account
as a collaborator, and then add the repos as submodules. That doesn't mean
you have to make your own repo to add to this one, by all means add files here
too.

For managing branches and stuff, that aren't in submodules,
let's try and push stuff up to personal branches, and then, we'll
use the club github account to pull things into the respective years.

for example, Vansh clones the repo, does stuff on his branch of 2017, then he
or another club member gets onto the unmannedsystems-ucla account and pulls it
into the 2017 branch on the main repo, probably do this with a pull request.

Also, let's do commit messages like this:

[repo] - [branch]
	- bulleted
	- list
	- of
	- comments
	- and stuff

for an example, run the command "git log"
